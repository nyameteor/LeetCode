# 1171. Remove Zero Sum Consecutive Nodes from Linked List

- Difficulty: Medium
- Topics: Hash Table, Linked List
- Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-zero-sum-consecutive-nodes-from-linked-list/

## Description

Given the `head` of a linked list, we repeatedly delete consecutive sequences of nodes that sum to `0` until there are no such sequences.

After doing so, return the head of the final linked list.Â  You may return any such answer.

(Note that in the examples below, all sequences are serializations of `ListNode` objects.)

**Example 1:**

```
Input: head = [1,2,-3,3,1]
Output: [3,1]
Note: The answer [1,2,1] would also be accepted.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: head = [1,2,3,-3,4]
Output: [1,2,4]
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: head = [1,2,3,-3,-2]
Output: [1]
```

**Constraints:**

- The given linked list will contain between `1` and `1000` nodes.
- Each node in the linked list has `-1000 <= node.val <= 1000`.

## Solution

First, to identify consecutive sequences of zero-sum nodes, we can scan the linked list, calculate current prefix sum, and use a dict `seen` to store the last node of current prefix sum.

Next, to construct a linked list without consecutive zero-sum nodes, we can scan the linked list, calculate current prefix sum, and use the last node of the prefix sum as the next node, which will skip the consecutive zero-sum nodes.
