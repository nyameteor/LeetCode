## Description

Write a program to solve a Sudoku puzzle by filling the empty cells.

A sudoku solution must satisfy **all of the following rules**:

1. Each of the digits `1-9` must occur exactly once in each row.
2. Each of the digits `1-9` must occur exactly once in each column.
3. Each of the digits `1-9` must occur exactly once in each of the 9 `3x3` sub-boxes of the grid.

The `'.'` character indicates empty cells.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: board = [["5","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."],["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."],[".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."],["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"],["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"],["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"],[".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."],[".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"],[".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]]
Output: [["5","3","4","6","7","8","9","1","2"],["6","7","2","1","9","5","3","4","8"],["1","9","8","3","4","2","5","6","7"],["8","5","9","7","6","1","4","2","3"],["4","2","6","8","5","3","7","9","1"],["7","1","3","9","2","4","8","5","6"],["9","6","1","5","3","7","2","8","4"],["2","8","7","4","1","9","6","3","5"],["3","4","5","2","8","6","1","7","9"]]
Explanation:Â The input board is shown above and the only valid solution is shown below:

**Constraints:**

- `board.length == 9`
- `board[i].length == 9`
- `board[i][j]` is a digit or `'.'`.
- It is **guaranteed** that the input board has only one solution.

## Solution

We can use three arrays of sets (or fixed-size 2D arrays) to track seen numbers:

- One for each row
- One for each column
- One for each 3*3 box (`boxIndex := (row / 3) * 3 + col / 3`)

Then, we apply DFS backtracking for each cell in the board. At each empty cell:

- Try placing digits 1 to 9 that are valid according to the constraints.
- Update the tracking arrays and search the next cell.
- Backtrack if the placement doesn't lead to a solution.

**Tip:** Use a flattened index (0-80) in DFS instead of row/col, simplifying index calculation and base case handling.

This avoids redundant scanning of the board and ensures `O(1)` lookups for validity.
