## Description

There are a total of `numCourses` courses you have to take, labeled from `0` to `numCourses - 1`. You are given an array `prerequisites` where `prerequisites[i] = [ai, bi]` indicates that you **must** take course `bi` first if you want to take course `ai`.

- For example, the pair `[0, 1]`, indicates that to take course `0` you have to first take course `1`.

Return _the ordering of courses you should take to finish all courses_. If there are many valid answers, return **any** of them. If it is impossible to finish all courses, return **an empty array**.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0]]
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So the correct course order is [0,1].
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: numCourses = 4, prerequisites = [[1,0],[2,0],[3,1],[3,2]]
Output: [0,2,1,3]
Explanation: There are a total of 4 courses to take. To take course 3 you should have finished both courses 1 and 2. Both courses 1 and 2 should be taken after you finished course 0.
So one correct course order is [0,1,2,3]. Another correct ordering is [0,2,1,3].
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: numCourses = 1, prerequisites = []
Output: [0]
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= numCourses <= 2000`
- `0 <= prerequisites.length <= numCourses * (numCourses - 1)`
- `prerequisites[i].length == 2`
- `0 <= ai, bi < numCourses`
- `ai != bi`
- All the pairs `[ai, bi]` are **distinct**.

## Solution

The problem can be solved using **Topological Sort** via **Kahn's Algorithm**.

1. **Graph Representation**:
   - Treat courses as nodes and prerequisites as directed edges in a graph.
   - Track the in-degree (number of prerequisites) for each course.

2. **Process Nodes**:
   - Start with courses that have no prerequisites (in-degree = 0).
   - Use a **queue** to process these courses.
   - For each course, reduce the in-degree of its dependent courses. If a dependent courseâ€™s in-degree becomes zero, add it to the queue.

3. **Cycle Detection**:
   - If all courses are processed and added to the result list, return the list.
   - If not, return an empty array (indicating a cycle).
