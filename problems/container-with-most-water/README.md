# 11. Container With Most Water

- Difficulty: Medium
- Topics: Array, Two Pointers, Greedy
- Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/container-with-most-water/

## Description

You are given an integer array `height` of length `n`. There are `n` vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the `ith` line are `(i, 0)` and `(i, height[i])`.

Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Return _the maximum amount of water a container can store_.

**Notice** that you may not slant the container.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
Output: 49
Explanation: The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: height = [1,1]
Output: 1
```

**Constraints:**

- `n == height.length`
- `2 <= n <= 10^5`
- `0 <= height[i] <= 10^4`

## Solution

- Use two pointers starting from both ends.
- Always move the **shorter line** inward to maximize area, since width decreases, and we need a taller line to potentially increase the area.
